### Vision-based Integrated Pose Estimation of UAS and Moving Platforms   {#edit-navigation}

####  - Iyer, V. V., and Johnson, E. N., AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, AIAA, 2025. 

This work uses visual-inertial methods to estimate the integrated pose of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and a non-cooperative moving platform in a GPS-denied environment. A single integrated navigation filter comprising an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate the states of the UAS and platform. Stereo vision is used to compute the depth of feature points used in the estimation process. A generic process model is adopted for the platform that allows the pose estimation algorithm to be agnostic to the type of platform. The f ilter is also capable of estimating the shape of the platform. The algorithm can be used for applications such as autonomous ship deck landing, station keeping over a ship, tracking and following a moving vehicle, and obstacle avoidance. While tests are performed in a GPS-denied environment, the system can use GPS data, when available, to improve the filter performance, thus allowing both indoor and outdoor operations. Flight test results of the integrated pose estimation algorithm in an indoor setting are presented with the platform moving over a level terrain.

### Versatile UAS Platform for Indoor Law Enforcement and First Responders Applications

#### - Iyer, V. V., Axten, R., Valente, V. T., and Johnson, E. N., AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition, AIAA, 2025. 

The Penn State Autonomous Robotics Competition Club has developed a low-cost UAS platform to support law enforcement and first responders conducting indoor operations. The solution consists of single/multi-vehicle configurations, allowing for the distribution of tasks and addressing different aspects using different vehicles; for example, one UAS can perform reconnaissance while another UAS can simultaneously perform 3D mapping. The design of the mapping UAS vehicle is focused on providing a cost-effective solution with autonomous vision-based navigation, navigation in low light conditions, including thermal and night vision capabilities and two-way audio communications. The proposed solution is capable of operations including 2D and 3D mapping, indoor Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, and reconnaissance. The reconnaissance vehicle is designed to have low deployment time and provide a live video stream. A quadcopter configuration provides a viable balance between endurance and adequate thrust for both UAS to safely maneuver through the indoor environment. The proposed solution offers a versatile configuration capable of numerous applications, providing necessary situational awareness and flexibility to first responders.

### Observer controller identification of a medium-weight co-axial octocopter

#### - Iyer V. V., Johnson E. N., and Singla P., AIAA SciTech Forum, AIAA, 2022. 

In this work, system identification of the open-loop airframe characteristics of a mediumweight co-axial octocopter is performed using closed-loop simulated data. Data is generated from the closed-loop octocopter model at hover using moments and thrust as excitation signals. Observer/Controller Identification (OCID) is then used to estimate the observer, controller and system Markov parameters from the generated data. The Markov parameters are used to form the Hankel matrices, that form the basis of the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA) used to determine the minimal realization of the system matrices. The effect of noise on the system identification process is analyzed by computing the Mode Singular Values (MSV). The use of Eigensystem Realization Algorithm with Data Correlations (ERA/DC) is also explored to demonstrate the improvement in system identification in the presence of noise. The system identification process presented in this work can be used to determine the systemâ€™s modes that help in analyzing the handling qualities of the aircraft, which can be useful in improving simulation model fidelity and estimating higher order dynamics.

### Development of a Long Endurance VTOL UAS Platform for Search and Rescue Missions

#### - Iyer V. V., Axten R., Surendran V., Valente V. T., and Johnson E. N., 77th Annual Forum of the Vertical Flight Society, 2021. 

The Penn State Autonomous Robotics Competition Club has developed a platform tailored for use in Search and Rescue missions to support first responders. The key design drivers included the capacity to carry a 10 lb LTE system to extend coverage for first responders on the ground, capability for long endurance flights, cost effectiveness, and ease of setup and operation for a solo operator. A coaxial octocopter with a hybrid power configuration was designed, verified in simulation, and flight tested. With an estimated operational endurance of over 3 hours and high levels of autonomy including obstacle avoidance and object detection, the proposed solution provides a versatile configuration capable of numerous applications including emergency operations.

### Compound Rotorcraft Yaw Control Fault Detection

#### - Lewis J.A., Iyer V. V., and Johnson E. N., 76th Annual Forum of the Vertical Flight Society, 2020. 

Emerging vertical flight concepts being proffered for solutions to the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) mission set such as compound high speed rotorcraft can be designed with multiple, coupled control effectors thus creating redundant systems in one or two more axes to generate control forces and moments which allow for a range of trim states. In the FVL mission area future rotorcraft will be asked to fly into high threat environments where potential failure modes can be encountered due to enemy fire or mechanical failure causing reduction of the safe flight envelope. Fault detection creates options to increase the survivability of the crew and passengers allowing an emergency flight envelope to be proposed. One of the more serious potential failures due to enemy fire is a loss of yaw control. Faults in yaw control can be detected in a compound rotorcraft with a vectored thrust ducted propeller (VTDP) or similar anti-torque thruster. An online Kalman filter (KF) for a dimensional yaw moment coefficient model will be used to estimate vehicle yaw coefficients. Deviation from the nominal coefficients will be monitored based on the KF statistics in the case of both rudder and tail rotor failure at 60, 40, and 20 ft/s in forward flight. Both frozen zero rudder and ganged sector faults as well as failed tail rotor faults were successfully detected at all airspeeds except the failed tail rotor at 60 ft/s. For the yaw control faults considered, post fault excitation appears airspeed dependent. An online KF estimator for yaw control fault detection could successfully be integrated into the design of a compound rotorcraft with VTDP thereby increasing system safety.

### Testing and Validation of Ground Proximity Warning System using Virtual Terrain on Helicopters

#### - Kumar S. V. M. and Iyer V. V., Journal of Aerospace Sciences and Technologies, Vol 65, Issue 1A, pp. 135-139, 2013. 

In this work, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) was tested on a 5-tonne helicopter by first validating the system in a simulator using virtual terrain obstacles. The Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) was modified to create "virtual" terrain obstacles in the flight path of the helicopter. The efficacy of the warning system was tested validating the envelope. The method helped in reducing the number of flights needed to validate the system thereby providign great cost benefits and helping mitigate any risks involved in flying into an actuall terrain.
